# my-cv

This project is hosted on VSTS (https://hometown1730.visualstudio.com/MyCV).
The goal of this project is to create and maintain an interactive version of my CV and to serve as a way to put to practices my skills on the latest technologies.
Currently its will be implemented as an Angular application and I will try to use its latest features.
The reason the project is hosted on VSTS is for practicing purposes too. I want to practice with VSTS (a tool I think is awesome) and improve my knowledge about it.

The source code will be made public once I've reached an stable enough version and I will maintain both repositories in sync.
Suggestions are very welcomed!
